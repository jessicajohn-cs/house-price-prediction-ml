# House Price Prediction (ML)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques based on multiple property features. The goal is to provide accurate price estimations to support real estate analytics and decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Main programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development and experimentation environment

## 📊 Features & Implementation
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to understand feature relationships and patterns
- **Machine Learning Model:** Regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict house prices
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics include R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- **Insights:** Identifying key factors affecting house prices
